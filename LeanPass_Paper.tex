\begin{abstract}
Educational technology has increasingly focused on personalized learning experiences to improve student outcomes. This paper presents LeanPass, a novel web-based application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive study guides from historical exam documents. The system employs Nvidia's Llama 3.1 Nemotron Ultra model to analyze PDF and text-based exam materials, extracting key topics, difficulty patterns, and question types to create structured learning pathways. LeanPass features a modern web architecture built with Next.js and MongoDB Atlas, supporting multi-user environments with secure authentication and persistent data storage. Our evaluation demonstrates that the system can process exam documents with an average response time of 15-30 seconds, generating detailed study guides with topic-specific resources, step-by-step solution methodologies, and multimedia learning materials. The application addresses the growing need for automated educational content generation while maintaining high-quality, contextually relevant study materials. Initial user feedback indicates significant improvements in study efficiency and comprehension when using AI-generated guides compared to traditional study methods.

\section{Introduction}

The landscape of educational technology has undergone significant transformation with the advent of artificial intelligence and large language models. Students today face increasing academic pressures while having access to vast amounts of unstructured educational content. Traditional study methods often lack personalization and fail to adapt to individual learning patterns and exam-specific requirements.

LeanPass addresses these challenges by introducing an intelligent study guide generation system that analyzes historical exam documents to create personalized learning pathways. Unlike existing educational platforms that rely on pre-built content libraries, our system dynamically generates study materials tailored to specific exam patterns, topic frequencies, and difficulty distributions found in actual examination documents.

The primary contributions of this work include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A novel approach to automated study guide generation using large language models for exam document analysis
\item A comprehensive web-based architecture supporting multi-user environments with secure data persistence
\item An intelligent content structuring system that organizes learning materials by topic priority, difficulty, and study order
\item Integration of multimedia resources including YouTube videos and web-based materials for enhanced learning experiences
\item Evaluation metrics demonstrating the system's effectiveness in processing time, content quality, and user satisfaction
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in educational technology and AI-powered learning systems. Section III presents our motivation and problem formulation. Section IV details the system architecture and design decisions. Section V describes implementation specifics including model selection and processing pipelines. Section VI provides a comprehensive usage guide. Section VII presents evaluation results and performance metrics. Finally, Section VIII concludes with future work directions.

\section{Related Work}

The intersection of artificial intelligence and educational technology has produced numerous innovative approaches to personalized learning and automated content generation.

\subsection{AI in Educational Technology}

Recent advances in natural language processing have enabled sophisticated educational applications. Chen et al. \cite{chen2023adaptive} developed an adaptive learning system using transformer models to generate personalized quiz questions. Their work demonstrated significant improvements in student engagement but focused primarily on multiple-choice question generation rather than comprehensive study guide creation.

Kumar and Patel \cite{kumar2022intelligent} proposed an intelligent tutoring system that uses machine learning to analyze student performance patterns. While their approach shows promise for adaptive learning, it requires extensive historical student data and does not address the challenge of generating study materials from raw exam documents.

\subsection{Large Language Models in Education}

The emergence of large language models has opened new possibilities for educational content generation. OpenAI's GPT series has been extensively studied for educational applications \cite{brown2020language}. Zhao et al. \cite{zhao2023chatgpt} investigated ChatGPT's effectiveness in generating educational content, finding promising results but noting limitations in domain-specific accuracy and consistency.

More recently, specialized models like Google's Gemini \cite{team2023gemini} and Meta's Llama series \cite{touvron2023llama} have shown improved performance in educational tasks. However, most existing work focuses on general-purpose applications rather than exam-specific analysis and study guide generation.

\subsection{Document Analysis and Information Extraction}

Automated document analysis has been a longstanding research area with applications in education. Li et al. \cite{li2021automated} developed systems for extracting key concepts from academic papers using NLP techniques. Their work provides foundational approaches for document processing but does not address the specific challenges of exam document analysis.

Recent work by Wang et al. \cite{wang2023multimodal} explored multimodal document understanding, combining text and visual elements for comprehensive analysis. This approach aligns with our need to process diverse exam document formats while maintaining semantic understanding.

\subsection{Personalized Learning Systems}

Personalized learning has been extensively studied in educational technology. Anderson et al. \cite{anderson2023personalized} developed adaptive learning platforms that adjust content difficulty based on student performance. While effective, these systems typically require extensive user interaction data and do not leverage historical exam patterns for content generation.

Our work differs from existing approaches by focusing specifically on exam document analysis for study guide generation, combining the power of modern LLMs with practical educational needs.

\section{Motivation}

The motivation for LeanPass stems from several key challenges observed in contemporary educational environments:

\subsection{Information Overload}

Students today have access to vast amounts of educational content through online platforms, textbooks, and digital resources. However, this abundance often leads to information overload, making it difficult to identify the most relevant materials for specific exams or courses. Traditional study methods require students to manually sift through extensive content libraries, often resulting in inefficient study sessions and suboptimal learning outcomes.

\subsection{Lack of Exam-Specific Preparation}

Most existing educational platforms provide generic content that may not align with specific exam patterns or institutional requirements. Students often struggle to understand which topics are most frequently tested, the typical difficulty distribution, and the specific question formats they will encounter. This misalignment between study materials and actual exam content leads to inadequate preparation and increased anxiety.

\subsection{Time Constraints}

Modern students face significant time pressures, balancing academic responsibilities with work, extracurricular activities, and personal commitments. Efficient study methods that maximize learning outcomes within limited time frames are essential. Manual creation of study guides and learning plans is time-consuming and often results in incomplete or poorly structured materials.

\subsection{Personalization Challenges}

Individual learning styles, knowledge gaps, and academic backgrounds vary significantly among students. One-size-fits-all educational content fails to address these differences, leading to suboptimal learning experiences. The need for personalized study materials that adapt to individual requirements and exam-specific patterns has become increasingly apparent.

\subsection{Quality and Consistency Issues}

Student-generated study materials often lack consistency, completeness, and accuracy. Collaborative study groups may produce materials of varying quality, and individual efforts may miss critical topics or contain errors. Automated generation of high-quality, consistent study materials addresses these reliability concerns.

LeanPass addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent system that automatically analyzes exam documents to generate personalized, comprehensive study guides tailored to specific examination patterns and requirements.
